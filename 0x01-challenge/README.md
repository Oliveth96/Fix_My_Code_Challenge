<h1>0x00. Fix my code</h1>


<h4>Background Context</h4>

Fix my code is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.
You should not recode everything, just fix it!

| TASKS | FILES | DESCRIPTION |
|----|---|--------------|
| 0. Server status | [status_server/](https://github.com/Oliveth96/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge/status_server/) | I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation). But I don’t know why it’s not working… Could you look at it and fix it please |
| 1. My square | [square.py](https://github.com/Oliveth96/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge/square.py)| I love geometry! |
| 2. Step 2: User model | [user.py](https://github.com/Oliveth96/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge/user.py) | I’m running into a serious problem! I just start my OOP project and nothing works… Could you help me please? |
| 3. Blog access | [blog](https://github.com/Oliveth96/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge/blog)| I finished and deployed my Rails blog but people are contacting me because they can’t access any of my blog posts… Weird, it works for me.. I would like to add a boolean online for each Post object with a default value true. With this boolean, I will be able to hide/show some blog posts from the listing. I will also need a way to change this boolean in the Post#edit route. Could you do this for me?|
| 4. Never leave the office | [react-blog](https://github.com/Oliveth96/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x01-challenge/react-blog)| I’m coming back from 2 weeks of holidays in France and when I arrived at the office, the first words from my marketing co-worker were: “Hi, how was your holiday? by the way, I think I broke the website.. Arf, I have also the pagination to fix… I didn’t have time before my break to look at it|
